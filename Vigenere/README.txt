This is a command line tool that breaks the Vigen√®re cypher on Lorem Ipsum texts.
The blocksize should be between 1 and 100, the Alphabet should only consist of ASCII characters.
If you want to use this tool for other languages a sample text in that language should be sufficient.
It can be changed in the LANGUAGE variable in the Code.

Usage:

To decrypt the Lorem text just pass the cryptotext as the first argument
and your desired destination of the cleartext as the second:

python3 vigenere.py encryptet_ipsum.txt destination_cleartext.txt
